The following table lists user-configurable options for the
MusicBox interface.  These can be set in various ways, which are
described after the list of options.

<tr><td>anticipationTime</td>
	<td> -20</td>
	<td>
	The time-to-quarter-note alignment table is polled periodically
	for event updated.  Typically this happens at about 40 Hz (every
	25 milliseconds).  If a future event is very close to the 
	current event, it may be better to include the future event
	with the current events.  In addition, there may be a time
	lag between detecting that an event occurs and when the 
	notes are highlighted in a score.  Therefore this parameter gives an 
	absolute time adjustment with respect the the current
	media time.  For example <tt>-20</tt> means that any event occuring
	up to 20 millseconds into the future will be activated now.
	Also see the <a href="#pollFrequency">pollFrequency</a> option.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>idPostfix</td>
	<td class="quote"></td>
	<td>
	This option is used to generate unique IDs when more than one
	MusicBox interface is given on a webpage.  Each MusicBox on a
	page must have a unique <tt>idPostfix</tt> option value so that
	the MusicBoxes can work independently.  All selector options
	which are IDs will have this tag appended to the ID.  For example,
	<tt>#musicbox-score-container</tt> with 
	<tt>idPostFix</tt>=<tt>-mvmt1</tt> will generate a final
	ID of <tt>#musicbox-score-container-mvmt1</tt>.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>pollFrequency</td>
	<td>20</td>
	<td>
	This is the repeat rate in milliseconds for the polling
	function which monitors the current time in the video, and
	then checks the timemap for any new events to process.  The
	default value is 20 millseconds, although the common minimum
	time for <tt>setInterval()</tt> is about 23 milliseconds.
	Also see the <a href="#anticipationtime">anticipationtime</a>
	option.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>scoreDataSelector</td>
	<td class="quote">#musicbox-score-data</td>
	<td>
	When the score definition data is stored on the page, or
	within a script loaded into the page, this is the ID of
	the script element which stores the data for the score
	definition.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>scoreSelector</td>
	<td class="quote">#musicbox-score-container</td>
	<td>
	This is the selector ID for the div element 
	on the page into which the score should be placed.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>scrollAnimationTime</td>
	<td> 800</td>
	<td>
	This is the time to take when scrolling from one musical system
	to another while playing the score.  The default time is 800 
	milliseconds.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>timemapsDataSelector</td>
	<td class="quote">#musicbox-timemaps-data</td>
	<td>
	When timemaps are embedded into the HTML page, or loaded
	as scripts onto the page, this is the ID of the script in which
	the timemap data is located.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>titleSelector</td>
	<td class="quote">.musicbox-title</td>
	<td>
	If a webpage contains an element with the class name given
	by this option, then any title found in the JSON score data
	will be displayed within that element.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>systemViewCount</td>	
	<td> 1</td>
	<td>
	In the default video display mode as well as the boxed
	audio or plain score modes, this number indicates the number
	of musical systems to display at one time.  The default value 
	of <tt>1</tt> indicates that only one system will be displayed at
	a time.  The height of the box will be set to the maximum 
	system height times the number of systems to view.
	</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>videoSelector</td>
	<td class="quote">#musicbox-video-container</td>
	<td>
	This is the ID for the element into which a video element
	should be inserted on the page.
	</td>
</tr>

<p> MusicBox options can be set in several ways:
<ol>

<li> by <tt>MusicBox.setOption()</tt>, such as:
<tt>musicbox.setOption(pollFrequency, 50)</tt>,
which would set the <tt>pollFrequency</tt> option
to 50 milliseconds.

</ol>
